Time-step :  150                    # in days

# Initial configurations
Initial massive bodies configuration : sun+neptune    # use "sun+gas_planets" or "sun+neptune"
Initial test-particles configuration : random             # use "random"

# Computation settings
Integration method : leapfrog          # use "leapfrog" or "MVS"
Integration mode :  gpu_multi_step               # use "cpu", "gpu" or "gpu_multi_step"
