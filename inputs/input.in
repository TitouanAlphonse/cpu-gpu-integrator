# Input file

# General parameters
Number of massive bodies : 5
Number of test-particles : 0
Integration over :   10000 steps      # use "(number of steps) steps", "(integration time) years" or "(computation time) minutes"
Time-step :  10                    # in days

# Initial configurations
Initial massive bodies configuration : sun+gas_planets    # use "sun+gas_planets"
Initial test-particles configuration : random             # use "random"

# Computation settings
Integration method : leapfrog          # use "leapfrog"
Integration mode :  gpu                # use "cpu", "gpu" or "gpu_multi-step"
Number of blocks used :  300           # for GPU calculations
Number of threads per block : 1024     # for GPU calculations
Number of sub-steps :  2

# File writing settings
File name suffix : none              # use "none" for no suffix, "mode" to match the integration mode or any custom string (no spaces)
Positions writing frequency : 1 step     # writes positions every "(number of steps) steps" or "(percentage of total simulation) %"
